# Overview

With this project, I took a brief look at making games with pygame.

It's a simple brick breaker clone.
You can use your mouse to move the catapult (paddle) to bounce the ball up.
The ball can break the bricks in the castle wall.
Your goal is to shatter the magic orb in the evil wizards castle.
You only get one shot at this.

To run the program you need to create a virtual environment and install pygame.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install pygame
```

Then run the game with `python src/main.py` from the main directory.

I just wanted to make a fun little game in pygame, and try things out.
I made it a brick breaker clone to focus more on creating the game and less on designing it.

# Development Environment

I used Python with pygame to create this game.

I used virtual environments to install

# Useful Websites

* [PyGame docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
* [How to set up virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

# Future Work

* Add sound effects
* Improve collision resolution with orb
* Create an harder difficulty mode
